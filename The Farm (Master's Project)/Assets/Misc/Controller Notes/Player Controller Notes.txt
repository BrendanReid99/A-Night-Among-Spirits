 -> Player is merely armed with one single tool (camera) to see in the dark
 -> First-Person
 
- Would it be ideal for our game that the player can only see if a light source is present i.e., walking with a candle / torch?

- Should the player be allowed to strafe, or be able to look around corners if pressed up against one?

- Should we allow the player to be able to look behind them?
	-> Example: Press a key, turns the camera to 'look over' the player shoulder?
	
- Crosshair for centre screen
	-> Great for player experience!
	-> Allows player to understand where they are currently 'DIRECTLY' facing and how to interact with objects better.
	
- Movement Ideas
	-> Fast walk? (Shift Key)
	-> Crawl / Crouch (Ctrl Key)
	-> Standard WASD movement

- Movement Restrictions
	-> Should we have the player not be able to walk directly into a wall?
		->> Example: If the player is walking towards a wall, it can detect how close you are and then slow the player movement down to zero?

	-> Should we have fatique as a mechanic?
		->> Example: The player should act as normal to a human as possible, so, should we incorporate heart rate? Rest periods?
		
- Are we able to look down and see the player's feet? *Common in first person games now.
